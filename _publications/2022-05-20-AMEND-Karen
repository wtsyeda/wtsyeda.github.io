<b> Abstract: </b> This double-blinded randomized controlled trial investigates the effects of adding memantine to amisulpride in antipsychotic-naïve first-episode psychosis patients, focusing on reducing negative symptoms and improving cognition. Using advanced 7T MRI and MRS, the study aims to uncover neurobiological mechanisms underlying dual receptor modulation and inform future patient stratification strategies.
