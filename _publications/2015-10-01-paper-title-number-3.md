<b> Abstract </b> This study examines the relationship between structural and functional brain connectivity and executive function impairments in antipsychotic-naïve patients with first-episode schizophrenia. Findings reveal group-specific interactions between cognitive flexibility, planning abilities, and connectivity in key brain regions, highlighting distinct neural mechanisms underlying executive dysfunction in schizophrenia.
