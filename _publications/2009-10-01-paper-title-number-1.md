excerpt: 'This study employs self-organizing maps, a machine learning technique, to identify six distinct cognitive profiles across the psychosis continuum, encompassing healthy controls, ultra-high-risk individuals, and first-episode psychosis patients. These profiles, driven by cognitive flexibility and executive functions, predict functional outcomes and highlight the potential of data-driven approaches for personalized treatment and cross-diagnostic research.'

<b> Abstract: </b> This study employs self-organizing maps, a machine learning technique, to identify six distinct cognitive profiles across the psychosis continuum, encompassing healthy controls, ultra-high-risk individuals, and first-episode psychosis patients. These profiles, driven by cognitive flexibility and executive functions, predict functional outcomes and highlight the potential of data-driven approaches for personalized treatment and cross-diagnostic research.
