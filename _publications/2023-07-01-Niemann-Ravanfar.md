excerpt: 'This study employs self-organizing maps, a machine learning technique, to identify six distinct cognitive profiles across the psychosis continuum, encompassing healthy controls, ultra-high-risk individuals, and first-episode psychosis patients. These profiles, driven by cognitive flexibility and executive functions, predict functional outcomes and highlight the potential of data-driven approaches for personalized treatment and cross-diagnostic research.'

<b> Abstract: </b> This study used 7T MRI to identify increased brain iron in the pulvinar nucleus and thalamic atrophy in Niemann-Pick type C, correlating with greater disease severity. These findings suggest a link between brain iron dysregulation and neurodegeneration in this condition, aligning with observations in other neurodegenerative disorders.
