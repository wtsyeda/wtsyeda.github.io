excerpt: 'This study used multiblock partial least squares correlation (MB-PLS-C) to identify distinct brain structure-cognition patterns in treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS) compared to healthy controls. Findings highlight TRS-specific cortico-cognitive alterations, particularly in frontal and temporal regions, providing a potential structural-cognitive signature for TRS.'

<b> Abstract: </b> This study used multiblock partial least squares correlation (MB-PLS-C) to identify distinct brain structure-cognition patterns in treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS) compared to healthy controls. Findings highlight TRS-specific cortico-cognitive alterations, particularly in frontal and temporal regions, providing a potential structural-cognitive signature for TRS.
