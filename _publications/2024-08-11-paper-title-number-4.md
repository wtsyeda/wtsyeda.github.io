<b> Abstract: </b> This study demonstrates that automated computer vision analysis of facial expressions can effectively capture negative, positive, and general symptom domains in first-episode psychosis. Additionally, baseline facial expression patterns were associated with treatment response, highlighting the potential of this approach for objective assessment in clinical psychiatry.
