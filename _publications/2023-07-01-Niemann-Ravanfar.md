excerpt: 'This study used 7T MRI to identify increased brain iron in the pulvinar nucleus and thalamic atrophy in Niemann-Pick type C, correlating with greater disease severity. These findings suggest a link between brain iron dysregulation and neurodegeneration in this condition, aligning with observations in other neurodegenerative disorders.'

<b> Abstract: </b> This study used 7T MRI to identify increased brain iron in the pulvinar nucleus and thalamic atrophy in Niemann-Pick type C, correlating with greater disease severity. These findings suggest a link between brain iron dysregulation and neurodegeneration in this condition, aligning with observations in other neurodegenerative disorders.
