<b> Abstract: </b> This study developed a Support Vector Machine model to predict short-term remission in first-episode psychosis using clinical scale data, achieving reliable results across cohorts. The model demonstrates potential as a clinical tool for early remission prediction, warranting further validation and testing in routine practice.
