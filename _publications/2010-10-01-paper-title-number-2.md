excerpt: 'This study examines white matter (WM) alterations in individuals with cannabis use disorder (CUD) using advanced MRI techniques, revealing increased structural connectivity in parietal-cortical regions and altered WM density in the corpus callosum, cingulum, and cerebellum. These findings provide insight into the neural correlates of CUD and their associations with cannabis use patterns.'

</b> Abstract </b>This study examines white matter (WM) alterations in individuals with cannabis use disorder (CUD) using advanced MRI techniques, revealing increased structural connectivity in parietal-cortical regions and altered WM density in the corpus callosum, cingulum, and cerebellum. These findings provide insight into the neural correlates of CUD and their associations with cannabis use patterns.
