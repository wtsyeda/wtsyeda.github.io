<b> Abstract: </b> This study investigates long-term structural brain changes in a rat model of mild focal ischemic stroke, revealing significant cortical atrophy and white matter degeneration persisting up to 48 weeks. Findings highlight enduring remote neurodegeneration, driven by axonal damage and inflammation, in regions connected to the infarct.
