<b> Abstract: </b> This study uses advanced fixel-based analysis (FBA) to identify fibre-specific white matter (WM) abnormalities in antipsychotic-naïve first-episode schizophrenia patients. Findings reveal distinct WM alterations associated with psychosis-specific and anxio-depressive symptoms, supporting an itemized approach to understanding symptom-specific neural dysconnectivity in schizophrenia.
